The Reader module for Moodle 2.x
======================================

The Reader module for Moodle 2.x tracks the students' reading achievements by maintaining a total of the number words each student reads. After reading one of the books at an appropriate reading level, a student takes quiz to demonstrate a reasonable understanding of the content of the book. If they pass the quiz, the number of words in the book is added to the total number of words they have read. Students are encouraged to work toward the reading goal, which is the number of words the teacher expects them to read in a term. Various reports are available to the teacher who can adjust the reading goals, student levels, and book difficulty if required.

======================================
To INSTALL or UPDATE the Reader module
======================================

    1. get the files for this plugin from any one of the following locations:

        (a) GIT: https://github.com/gbateson/moodle-mod_reader.git
        (b) CVS: the Moodle CVS repository (contrib/plugins/mod/reader)
        (c) zip: the Moodle.org -> Plugins repository (search for Reader)
        (d) zip: http://bateson.kanazawa-gu.ac.jp/zip/plugins_mod_reader.zip

       If you are installing from a zip file, unzip the zip file, to create a folder called "reader"
       and upload or move this "reader" folder to the "mod" folder on your Moodle 2.x site
       to create a new folder at "mod/reader" - not "mod/reader/reader" :-)

    2. log in to Moodle as administrator to initiate install/upgrade

        if install/upgrade does not begin automatically, you can initiate it manually by navigating to the following link:
        Settings -> Site administration -> Notifications
